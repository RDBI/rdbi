* Bump version
* [deprecation] Statement#prep_finalizer considered harmful
  Internal API:  driver authors, do not use.  RDBI::Util offers upon_finalize!
  but this may not be needed as RDBI's own finalizations now will finish()
  driver sth and result set data objects.
* [bugfix] issue#33 (memory leak) addressed with new finalization and weakened
  sth objects held by Result objects.
* [bugfix] Result no longer finish()es Statement (issue#34)
