# RDBI::Database is the base class for database handles. This is the primary
# method in which most users will access their database system.
#
# To execute statements, look at +prepare+ and +execute+.
#
# To retrieve schema information, look at +schema+ and +table_schema+.
#
# To deal with transactions, +transaction+, +commit+, and +rollback+.

  # Open a new transaction for processing. Accepts a block which will execute
  # the portions during the transaction.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   dbh.transaction do |dbh|
  #       dbh.execute("some query")
  #       dbh.execute("some other query")
  #       raise "oh crap!" # would rollback
  #       dbh.commit # commits
  #       dbh.rollback # rolls back
  #   end
  #
  #   # at this point, if no raise or commit/rollback was triggered, it would
  #   # commit.
  #
  # Any exception that isn't caught within this block will trigger a
  # rollback. Additionally, you may use +commit+ and +rollback+ directly
  # within the block to terminate the transaction early -- at which point
  # *the transaction is over with and you may be in autocommit*. The
  # RDBI::Database accessor +in_transaction+ exists to tell you if RDBI
  # thinks its in a transaction or not.
  #
  # If you do not +commit+ or +rollback+ within the block and no exception is
  # raised, RDBI presumes you wish this transaction to succeed and commits
  # for you.
  #
