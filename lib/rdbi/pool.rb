# RDBI::Pool - Connection Pooling.
#
# Pools are named resources that consist of N concurrent connections which all
# have the same properties. Many group actions can be performed on them, such
# as disconnecting the entire lot.
#
# RDBI::Pool itself has a global accessor, by way of +RDBI::Pool::[]+, that can
# access these pools by name. Alternatively, you may access them through the
# RDBI.pool interface.
#
# Pools are thread-safe and are capable of being resized without disconnecting
# the culled database handles.
#
